# ADT : Abstract Data Type

When we have a type where we can perform some operations we call them Abstract.
example of ADT is queue data structure:
concept: First In First Out

when we have a concept and associates operations along with data then it is called as Abstract Data Type.


## Array

Searching an element in sorted array

1. Linear search : look for an element by traversing over all elements from start to end
2. Binary search : Divide and conquer (for each step we are removing half array from consideration)

In both of these approaches, how to understand which one is efficient?\
Time complexity

## Time complexity
Time Complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorith increases with the size of the input data.
to understand time complexity we use Big O Notation

### Big O Notations
1. O(1) : Constant Time
2. O(log n) : Logrithmic Time
3. O(n) : Linear Time
4. O(n log n) : Linearithmic Time
5. O(n^2) : Quadratic Time
6. O(2^n) : Exponential Time
7. O(n!) : Factorial Time
