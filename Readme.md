Data types:

1. Primitive : 
Integer => byte (1 bytes), short (2 bytes), int (4 bytes), long (8 bytes)
Float => float(4 bytes), double(default 8 bytes)
Character => char (2 bytes)
Boolean => boolean (true or false)
2. Non-primitive :
String
Array
Object

 
Stack and Heap:

Stack is a memory area where local variables are stored. It is a LIFO (Last In First Out)
Heap is a memory area where objects are stored.

String: strings in Java are immutable. This means that once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed.

Mutable string : can be change (String buffer and String builder)
Immutable string : can't be change

this and super method: 
this() calls constructor of the same class.
super() calls constructor of the parent class and this method stays there in every constructor by default. every class in java is a child class of Object class.
